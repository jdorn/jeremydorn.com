About Me
-------------

Phoenix -> San Francisco -> Boston -> Austin

I'm currently working as lead software architect for <a href='https://www.education.com' target='_blank'>education.com</a> where I get to build awesome products used by millions of parents and teachers every month.

I also regularly contribute to open source projects and even have <a href='projects'>a few of my own</a>.
