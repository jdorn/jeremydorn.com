About Me
-------------

I'm an Arizona native now living in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I graduated from Arizona State in 2011 with a BS in Computer Science and a Business minor.

I'm currently working as a software engineer for <a href='http://education.com' target='_blank'>education.com</a> where I get to build awesome products used by millions of parents and teachers every
month.

I also regularly contribute to open source projects and even have <a href='projects'>a few of my own</a>.
