I haven't been able to spend a ton of time recently on Open Source, but here are some of my past projects:

<h3 class='red'>JSON Editor</h3>

Written in vanilla JS with no dependencies.  Works standalone, but can also integrate with multiple 3rd party CSS frameworks, icon libraries, and templating engines.
